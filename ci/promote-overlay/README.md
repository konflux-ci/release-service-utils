# Promotion of Release Service overlays in the infra-deployments repo

## Introduction

The Release Service in RHTAP is deployed to environments using ArgoCD. The specific content to be deployed to each environment is controlled by overlays.

There are 3 overlays:
- development
- staging
- production

Currently, when a PR is merged in the release-service repo, a PR in the infra-deployments repo is created by a RHTAP release pipeline which updates the **development** overlay. 

Promotion from a lower environment to higher environment is done manually by updating the target overlay.

This script helps to automate this promotion. It analyzes the commits between the source and the target overlays and creates an infra-deployments PR updating the overlay file and includes a changelog.

## Performance & Rate Limiting

The script uses GitHub's GraphQL API to efficiently fetch PR information for all commits in a single request (or batches of 50 commits). This approach:

- **Avoids rate limiting**: Reduces API calls from N (one per commit) to 1-2 calls total
- **Faster execution**: Completes in seconds instead of minutes
- **Automatic retry**: Built-in rate limit detection and retry logic (3 attempts with 60-second delays)
- **Better reliability**: Prevents incomplete changelogs due to rate limit errors

For typical promotion batches of 20-50 commits, this is approximately 40-60x faster than individual API calls.

## Setup

* The script requires an environment variable called _**GITHUB_TOKEN**_ to exist. This token should have the following scopes:

![Required Github token scopes](github-token-scopes.png)

* The script also has 3 required arguments
  * **source-overlay**: Name of the source overlay to promote to target
  * **target-overlay**: Name of the overlay to target for promotion
  * **fork-owner**: Name of the owner of your infra-deployments fork in Github

## Running the script

```
% ./ci/promote-overlay/promote-overlay.sh --source-overlay development  --target-overlay staging --fork-owner scoheb
```

## Example output
```
